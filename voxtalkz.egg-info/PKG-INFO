Description: 
        # voxtalkz
        
        voxtalkz is an open source python library that aims to provide a service to convert play-like-scripts to semi-relisic audio-dramas.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        voxtalkz needs several python libraries to function:
        Google Text To Speach (gTTS)
        Pydub (pydub)
        
        if pulling from github, use the following commands:
        ```
        pip3 install gTTS
        pip3 install pydub
        ```
        
        ## Installing
        
        otherwise, just run this command
        
        **Note: pip support has not been tested, the 'testing' section may not work if the following command is used**
        
        `pip3 install voxtalkz` **May not work. Testing would be appriciated**
        
        **This method HAS been tested**
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/DonFlymoor/voxTalkz.git
        cd voxTalkz
        ```
        The following command will locally install voxtalkz, so the command `python3 -m voxtalkz ... ...` will work.
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        ## Testing
        
        Write a short script and save it as `test.script`.
        ```
        # Assign a name to an actor
        Susan:british_woman
        
        # Make her say Hello, World!
        Susan:Hello, World!
        ```
        Open the commandline and navigate to your file.
        
        Run the script.
        
        ```
        python3 -m voxtalkz test.script test --debug
        ```
        
        Assuming all went well, you should see a file named test.mp3. Play it with your favorate mp3 playing programming.
        (Other filetypes will be made avilable upon request)
        
        ### Use a sound Effect
        
        Navigate to your home directory and create a folder named `.voxtalkz`.
        
        Navigate into that folder and create a new folder named `soundEffects`.
        
        Download a .mp3 sound effect and place it in the `~/.voxtalkz/soundEffects/` folder, for this tutorial we will assume the file is called `footsteps.mp3`.
        
        Write a short script and save it as `test2.script`.
        
        ```
        # Assign a name to an actor
        Susan:british_woman
        
        # Make her say Hello, World!
        Susan:Hello, World!
        Susan:Goodbye, World!
        
        # Add the soud effect
        *footsteps
        ```
        
        Open the commandline and navigate to your file.
        Run the script.
        
        ```
        python3 -m voxtalkz test2.script test2 --debug
        ```
        
        Play test2.mp3
        
        ### Adding a Modifier
        
        
        Write a short script and save it as `test3.script`.
        
        ```
        # Assign a name to an actor
        Susan:british_woman
        
        # Make her say Hello, World! as a little girl
        Susan:Hello, World!@PITCH=0.3
        
        # Make her say Goodbye, World! as an old woman
        Susan:Goodbye, World!@PITCH=-0.3
        ```
        
        Open the commandline and navigate to your file.
        Run the script.
        
        ```
        python3 -m voxtalkz test3.script test3 --debug
        ```
        
        Play the resulting test3.mp3.
        
        ## Using as a Python Library
        
        Copy `voxtalkz.py` to the folder with the python file you want to use it with.
        
        Add these line of code to your program:
        ```
        import voxtalkz
        ...
        TalkzBox = voxtalkz.voxTalkz(<scriptname>,<outputfilename>)
        Parsed = TalkzBox.Parse(TalkzBox.file)
        OutputSound = TalkzBox.ListToSound(Parsed)
        # OutputSound is an instance of pydub.AudioSegment. It can be proccesed with pydub now.
        OutputSound.export(filename, format='<.wav, .mp3, and others>')
        
        ```

        Usage: python3 -m voxtalkz [input file, output file] 
        
        Converts play-like script to a .mp3 file 
        Script file must be written in this manner: 
        
        #The first time a unknown name is called, instead of making the person talk, the name will be assigned to a person. 
        Susan:normal_woman
        #Then the person will "talk"
        Susan:Hello, world!
        #Comments are allowed!
        *soundeffect_without_filename_extension
        
        Effects can be applied by adding an @ symbal the the effect name, like so:
        person1:hello, world!@VOLUME=8
        A second effect can be applied by using the pipe("|") like so:
        person1:Hello, World!@FADE|VOLUME=8
        
        List of all effects:
        	@FADE | Fade to nothing
        	@FADE_IN | Fade in from silent
        	@OVERLAY | Overlays the sound onto what has already been recorded. Use @OVERLAY=VAR1 to START the overlay at the begining of where you assigned @VAR=1
        	@REPEAT= | Repeat audio segment however many times you specify. e.g. (normal_woman:Hello, world!@REPEAT=10) would produce Someone saying "Hello, world!" ten times
        	@VAR=    | Assign a number to a temporary table. Only used with @OVERLAY
        	@VOLUME= | Set volume change in decibels. A negitive number will reduce the volume
        	@PITCH=  | Set pitch change. e.g. "normal_woman:Hello, world!@PITCH=0.3" would make the person sound like a little girl, while "normal_woman:Hello, world!@PITCH=-0.3" would sound like an old woman
